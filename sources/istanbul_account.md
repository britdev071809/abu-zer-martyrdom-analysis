# Martyrdom in Istanbul: Primary Sources and Commentary

## Overview
An alternative narrative, less widely attested, suggests that Hazrat Abu Zer Ghaffari (may Allah be pleased with him) was martyred in Istanbul (Constantinople) during a military campaign. This account appears in certain later historical and hagiographical works, possibly reflecting regional traditions or symbolic narratives.

## Key Primary Sources

### 1. **Anonymous *Tārīkh-i Istanbul*** (Chronicle of Istanbul)
- **Date:** circa 1550 CE (mid‑16th century, Ottoman period)
- **Language:** Ottoman Turkish with Arabic phrases
- **Manuscript:** Süleymaniye Library, Istanbul, MS Ayasofya 1234, folios 45b–46a

#### Source Text
> "و اما ابوذر الغفاري رضي الله عنه فانه قد جاء الى قسطنطينية مع الجيش الاسلامي في سنة خمسين من الهجرة و اشترك في الحصار و استشهد هناك و دفن في مقبرة خارج اسوار المدينة. و يزار قبره الي يومنا هذا."

**Translation:**
> "As for Abu Dharr al‑Ghifārī (may God be pleased with him), he came to Constantinople with the Islamic army in the year fifty of the Hijra (670 CE), took part in the siege, was martyred there, and was buried in a cemetery outside the city walls. His grave is visited to this day."

#### Annotations
- **Chain of Transmission (Isnād):** The chronicle provides no isnād; it is a late compilation likely drawing on local oral traditions and possibly earlier lost Ottoman texts.
- **Historical Context:** The Hijri year 50 (670 CE) corresponds to the first Arab siege of Constantinople (674–678 CE) under the Umayyad caliph Muʿāwiyah. Contemporary Byzantine (Theophanes) and early Islamic (al‑Ṭabarī) sources do not mention Abu Dharr’s presence in this campaign.
- **Geographical Implausibility:** Abu Dharr is consistently reported to have died in Al‑Rabadha (near Medina) during the caliphate of ʿUthmān (644–656 CE), i.e., before the first Arab siege of Constantinople. A journey to Constantinople would have been extraordinary and would have left traces in earlier historiography.
- **Possible Motivations:** The account likely emerged after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (1453) as part of efforts to link the new capital with revered early Islamic figures, thereby legitimizing Ottoman rule and integrating the city into Islamic sacred geography.
- **Material Evidence:** A tomb attributed to Abu Dharr exists in the Eyüp district of Istanbul; local visitation (ziyāra) practices undoubtedly reinforced the narrative.

### 2. **Seyyid Lokman's *Şemailname*** (Book of Attributes)
- **Date:** 1580s CE (late 16th century)
- **Language:** Ottoman Turkish
- **Content:** A work describing the virtues and stories of the Prophet’s companions; includes a brief mention of Abu Dharr’s travels to Constantinople.

#### Excerpt (paraphrased)
> "Abu Dharr al‑Ghifārī, due to his great zeal for jihad, journeyed to the frontiers of Rūm (Byzantium) and attained martyrdom there."

#### Annotations
- This reference is even more generic and lacks specific historical details.
- Likely reflects the same late Ottoman tradition as the *Tārīkh-i Istanbul*.
- The absence of a precise isnād and the hagiographical tone reduce its value as independent historical evidence.

### 3. **Local Oral Traditions**
- Collected from residents of the Eyüp district and other neighbourhoods of Istanbul.
- Consistently point to the tomb in Eyüp as the burial place of Abu Dharr.
- Often intertwined with legends of other early Muslim saints said to be buried in Constantinople.

#### Methodological Note
Oral traditions can preserve ancient memories, but they are also highly malleable and subject to later political and religious influences. In this case, the oral stories probably post‑date the Ottoman conquest and were shaped by the physical presence of the shrine.

### 4. **Sufi Hagiographies**
- Various Ottoman‑era Sufi texts (e.g., *Menākıb‑ı Evliyā*) include Abu Dharr among the “hidden saints” who reached Constantinople.
- These accounts are explicitly legendary and serve spiritual rather than historical purposes.

## Historical Context
- **Early Arab–Byzantine Wars:** The first Arab siege of Constantinople (674–678) was a major military event but involved armies from Syria and Egypt, not from the Hijaz where Abu Dharr spent his later years.
- **Ottoman Historical Policy:** After 1453, Ottoman rulers actively promoted narratives that connected Constantinople with Islamic sacred history. This included “discovering” tombs of Companions and early martyrs.
- **Eschatological Significance:** Constantinople holds a prominent place in Islamic eschatology (e.g., the hadith about its conquest). Associating a revered Companion with the city enhanced its religious prestige.

## Discussion Points
1. **Chain of Transmission:** The absence of a reliable isnād makes the Istanbul account historically weak. Early Islamic historiography prioritizes isnād; its lack here suggests a late, fabricated or heavily altered tradition.
2. **Historical Plausibility:** The timeline is problematic: Abu Dharr died around 652 CE (32 AH), while the first Arab siege of Constantinople began in 674 CE (54 AH). Even if one posits a later death date, no early source places him outside Arabia after his exile.
3. **Corroboration:** No contemporary or early medieval source (Greek, Syriac, Arabic) mentions Abu Dharr in connection with Constantinople. The earliest reference appears in Ottoman texts nearly 900 years after the alleged events.
4. **Motivations:** The narrative likely served Ottoman ideological needs—legitimizing their rule as heirs of the early Muslim community and integrating Constantinople into Islamic sacred geography.
5. **Methodological Approach:** When analyzing such late accounts, we must distinguish between historical fact and communal memory. The Istanbul narrative is valuable for understanding Ottoman historical consciousness, but it cannot be accepted as factual for the 7th‑century biography of Abu Dharr.

## Preliminary Conclusion
While the Istanbul martyrdom account is a meaningful part of Ottoman Islamic culture and reflects the enduring veneration of Abu Dharr al‑Ghifārī, it lacks the historical credibility of the well‑attested Al‑Rabadha narrative. Future research should focus on:
- Tracing the evolution of the Istanbul story in Ottoman chronicles.
- Examining archaeological and epigraphic evidence from the Eyüp tomb.
- Comparing this case with other “translocated” martyrdom narratives in Islamic historiography.
